**IT Specialist**

I started my IT journey in 2022, and it ignited my passion for information technology and supporting end users. My goal is to earn degrees in network administration and information technology while collecting more certifications, ultimately becoming a network engineer and starting my own IT consulting company. I thrive on solving problems and helping others get their systems running smoothly again.
